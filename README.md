# RAGApplication

RAGApplication is a project designed to demonstrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, integrating language models with external knowledge sources to provide more accurate, context-aware responses. This repository provides the core logic and examples for building RAG-based applications, suitable for experimentation, prototyping, or production use.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Integrates retrieval from external knowledge bases with generative AI models.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend or adapt for custom data sources, vector stores, or model backends.
- **Example Workflows:** Includes scripts and notebooks for running typical RAG pipelines.
- **Language Model Integration:** Plug in your favorite LLM (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.) with minimal configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- (Optional) Docker for containerized deployment
- Recommended: Access credentials for your target LLM provider (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Programmer-DN-AI/RAGApplication.git
   cd RAGApplication
